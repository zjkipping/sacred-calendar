## About the App

Sacred calendar is a universal calendar that works seamlessly with your schedule.

It allows the user to edit, finalize, and share your schedule with friends.

Calendar sharing happens by having a friend click on your name and then they will be redirected to your calendar.
* Privacy is a big part of the app
* Private events will be blocked off on your calendar so your friends wont see what you are doing at that time
* You can allow your friends to view private events via friend specific settings
* Sacred calendar makes it easy to share your calendar with your friends and view your friends calendars
* This allows for better time management between friends
